Feature: Reporting and Analysis Workflows
  As a business analyst or manager
  I want to generate reports and perform analysis
  So that I can make data-driven decisions

  Background:
    Given SQLBot is running with full functionality
    And I have access to complete Sakila data
    And the system contains historical data for analysis

  Scenario: Daily operations report
    When I ask "Generate a daily operations summary for yesterday"
    Then SQLBot should identify relevant operational metrics
    And calculate call volumes, agent performance, and system usage
    And format results as a comprehensive daily report
    And include comparisons to previous periods where relevant

  Scenario: Agent performance analysis
    When I ask "Create an agent performance report for this month"
    Then SQLBot should gather agent-related metrics
    And calculate performance indicators like calls handled, resolution time
    And rank agents by key performance metrics
    And identify top performers and those needing improvement
    And format results in a management-friendly report

  Scenario: Trend analysis over time
    When I ask "Show me call volume trends over the last 6 months"
    Then SQLBot should aggregate data by time periods
    And calculate month-over-month changes
    And identify seasonal patterns or anomalies
    And present results with trend indicators
    And suggest potential causes for significant changes

  Scenario: Department comparison analysis
    When I ask "Compare performance across all departments this quarter"
    Then SQLBot should group metrics by department
    And calculate comparative statistics
    And identify best and worst performing departments
    And highlight significant differences between departments
    And suggest areas for improvement or best practice sharing

  Scenario: Customer satisfaction analysis
    When I ask "Analyze customer satisfaction metrics for the last month"
    Then SQLBot should identify satisfaction-related data
    And calculate satisfaction scores and trends
    And correlate satisfaction with other operational metrics
    And identify factors that impact customer satisfaction
    And suggest actionable improvements

  Scenario: Resource utilization report
    When I ask "How efficiently are we using our resources?"
    Then SQLBot should analyze agent utilization and capacity
    And identify peak usage times and bottlenecks
    And calculate efficiency ratios and productivity metrics
    And suggest optimal resource allocation strategies
    And highlight opportunities for improvement

  Scenario: Quality assurance analysis
    When I ask "Generate a quality report for our call handling"
    Then SQLBot should analyze quality-related metrics
    And identify common issues or failure patterns
    And calculate quality scores and compliance rates
    And highlight training opportunities or process improvements
    And track quality trends over time

  Scenario: Financial impact analysis
    When I ask "What's the financial impact of our call center operations?"
    Then SQLBot should calculate cost-related metrics
    And analyze cost per call, agent costs, and efficiency ratios
    And identify cost-saving opportunities
    And correlate operational metrics with financial outcomes
    And provide ROI analysis where possible

  Scenario: Predictive analysis
    When I ask "Predict next month's call volumes based on historical data"
    Then SQLBot should analyze historical patterns
    And identify seasonal trends and growth patterns
    And provide volume predictions with confidence intervals
    And suggest staffing recommendations based on predictions
    And highlight factors that might affect the forecast

  Scenario: Exception and anomaly reporting
    When I ask "Find any unusual patterns or anomalies in recent data"
    Then SQLBot should analyze data for statistical anomalies
    And identify outliers in key metrics
    And flag potential data quality issues
    And highlight operational exceptions that need attention
    And suggest investigation priorities

  Scenario: Compliance and audit reporting
    When I ask "Generate a compliance report for regulatory requirements"
    Then SQLBot should identify compliance-related metrics
    And calculate adherence to regulatory standards
    And highlight any compliance violations or risks
    And provide audit trail information where available
    And suggest remediation actions for any issues

  Scenario: Custom KPI dashboard
    When I ask "Create a dashboard showing our top 5 KPIs"
    Then SQLBot should identify the most important metrics
    And calculate current values and trends for each KPI
    And format results as a executive dashboard
    And include status indicators (green/yellow/red)
    And provide drill-down options for detailed analysis
